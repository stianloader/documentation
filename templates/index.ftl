	<h3>Welcome to stianloader.org/documentation!</h3>

	<p>Hint: The documentation is best consumed like a quick reference manual for when you are
	stuck. There is no point in reading the entirety of this documentation in advance if you
	are unsure of whether you'll use a particular library in the long term anyways.
	Also, don't forget the <a href="https://stianloader.org/jd">documentation provided
	in the javadocs</a>!</a>

	<p>Stianloader is an organisation that started out as a hub for galimulator modding.
	Evidently, that is no longer the case. Nowadays, Stianloader prides itself in exposing
	less experienced developers to software libraries with a more acquired usecase.
	Henceforth, the libraries are developed to be small, easy to grasp and with the appropriate
	documentation. Well, the documentation aspect might be a bit of a stretch, but it's nice
	to dream. If you do end up stuck somewhere, don't hesitate to <a href="https://discord.gg/CjnPMxsAX6">join the discord server</a>
